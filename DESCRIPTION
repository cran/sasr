Description: Provides a 'SAS' interface, through 'SASPy'(<https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/>) and 'reticulate'(<https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/>).
  This package helps you create 'SAS' sessions, execute 'SAS' code in remote 'SAS' servers, retrieve execution results and log, and exchange datasets between 'SAS' and 'R'.
  It also helps you to install 'SASPy' and create a configuration file for the connection. Please review the 'SASPy' license file as instructed so that you comply with its separate and independent license.
