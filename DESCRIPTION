Description: Provides a 'SAS' interface, through
    'SASPy'(<https://sassoftware.github.io/saspy/>) and
    'reticulate'(<https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/>).  This package
    helps you create 'SAS' sessions, execute 'SAS' code in remote 'SAS'
    servers, retrieve execution results and log, and exchange datasets
    between 'SAS' and 'R'.  It also helps you to install 'SASPy' and
    create a configuration file for the connection. Please review the
    'SASPy' license file as instructed so that you comply with its
    separate and independent license.
